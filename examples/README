This folder contains

(i)   A sub-folder enclosing  a bunch of comma separated value (csv) files.
      Each of these files encloses geometrical input features defined in atomic local 
      frames (ALF)  and topological properties (atomic energy and multipole moments)
      of all the atoms in 2000 conformers of ethanol.\

(ii)  A python script that import polus modules and executes several tasks intended
      to prepare training, validation and test sets for use in FEREBUS, a regression
      engine developed in the Popelier group. This script:\

      (1) Corrects atomic energies so that they sum up exactly to the wave function
          energy of the system.\

      (2) Specifies the sizes of training sets, going from 100 to 2000 geometries. \

      (3) Defines the path to the output directory. \

      (4) Removes potential extreme outliers from the dataset. These are geometries
          that fall away from mean+-4*sigma in the distributions of atomic energies.\

      (5) Removes geometries that fail on the electron density recovery test.\

      (6) Identifies excluded geometries.\

      (7) Carries out a diversity-aware selection procedure to identify the most 
          structurally unique geometries in the dataset.\

      (8) Writes the training, validation and test sets in csv files.\

This example task can be executed by running the script in the polus environment:\

python script.py \

For larger datasets, we recommend that a job script be written and submitted to a 
compute node. This is because step (7) above quikcly becomes very time-consuming and
memory-greedy.\
